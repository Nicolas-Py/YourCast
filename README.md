## The Problem: Information Overload in the Podcast Era

Each of us has direct access to the world's brightest minds of our time. Via Podcast, in our pockets, always. But still, we are lost.

Lost between the 8-hour Lex Fridman podcast, Andrew Huberman telling us to become carnivore, some new AI model supposedly crushing OpenAI, and something about tariffs.

The problem? Information overload. Cutting through the noise. Finding the content that is actually relevant to us. Without listening to 10 hours of podcasts each week, trying to catch the 5 minutes of hot insights.
